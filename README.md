Axiom is an operating system/UI thing for ComputerCraft 1.7x.

Axiom features such amazing things as:
 - being able to run, god damn it.
 - Password protection through salted hashes.
 - Various settings
 - File browser
 - Backgrounds
 - Multiuser support

What it currently lacks:
  - Desktop icons
  - Multitasking
  - A proper commandline
  

Forgot to mention, this version is community driven and completely independent to the original version.
